# Recipe Generator AI

## Introduction
The Recipe Generator AI is a deep learning-based model designed to create unique and creative recipes. Built using the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, this project explores the intersection of AI and culinary creativity. Whether you're looking for inspiration in the kitchen or simply curious about AI-generated recipes, this tool has you covered.

## Features
- Generates creative and unique recipes.
- Supports customizable inputs (e.g., ingredients, cuisine type, dietary restrictions).
- Uses pre-trained T5 for natural language understanding and generation.
- Easily extendable and fine-tunable for improved accuracy.

## Model Details
- **Base Model**: T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Training Time**: 14 hours
- **GPU**: NVIDIA (accelerated training for faster iterations)
- **Dataset**: Curated recipe dataset
